# PLC-Programming

PLC programming allows you to use real-life devices and logic virtually to make a stimulation. 

One of the first projects I made was the garage stimulation which allowed the garage door to open and close, stop in between. Certain lights would turn on when you were moving it up or down. 

The silo project, a box was to move from the assembly line to the silo to get it filled up to the right amount and then out of the frame. The programmer has to alert the switches, allow for infinite boxes and allow the box to stop at the silo. 

One of the more complicated projects was the bottle stimulation. 


In the silo design simulation, you have the chance to observe the flow of bulk solids from inside the silo. Direct shear test. In order to identify the material properties of the sand, you need to perform a direct shear test


The image below is of one of the harder projects or programs. It is a bottle line stimulator that to travel through the assembly line. The broke ones you have to filter out go to the bottom in the mixer. The unbroken bottles, depending on their size should get large fill or small fill. Lastly, for the undamaged bottles, put the cap on it. For the broken bottles, work out a timer and grind then everytime a broken bottle goes through the sensor. You could also edit yoru code to count the number of broken and fine bottles.

The hardest one was the elevator stimulation as seen below. The project really made the programmer think about "user" cases and how a normal elevator would function. When the elevator is going down button someone pushed the up button in one of the floor above, what should happen? When multiple people push the button which one should come first. You also have to code the numbers lights to allow residents to see which floor they are currently on.

One other project, was a traffic light stimulation. I unfortunately did not save this project but a picture of the stimulation is below. Just like to above project is made me think about the different cases for a traffic light and how to coded walk buttons, lights and the right of way sign. How should the program respond when the pedestrian clicks on the walk sign when the light is green. The timings of the traffic lights etc..

Overall, PLC programming, have me a real life insight on projects and allowed me to try something new. I was able to research and use input and output bits, timers and some elements from electricity. It really taught me how much thinking goes into everything. Even a simple traffic light intersection that we tend to overlook has so much thinking into it. You are constantly thinking about different use cases and conditions. I was able to open my mind into programming in a very practical and realisitic way.
