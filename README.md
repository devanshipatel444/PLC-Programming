# PLC-Programming

PLC programming allows you to use real-life devices and logic virtually to make a stimulation. 

One of the first projects I made was the garage stimulation which allowed the garage door to open and close, stop in between. Certain lights would turn on when you were moving it up or down. 

The silo project, a box was to move from the assembly line to the silo to get it filled up to the right amount and then out of the frame. The programmer has to alert the switches, allow for infinite boxes and allow the box to stop at the silo. 

One of the more complicated projects was the bottle stimulation. 


In the silo design simulation, you have the chance to observe the flow of bulk solids from inside the silo. Direct shear test. In order to identify the material properties of the sand, you need to perform a direct shear test


The image below is of one of the harder projects or programs. It is a bottle line stimulator that to travel through the assembly line. The broke ones you have to filter out go to the bottom in the mixer. The unbroken bottles, depending on their size should get large fill or small fill. Lastly, for the undamaged bottles, put the cap on it. For the broken bottles, work out a timer and grind then everytime a broken bottle goes through the sensor.
